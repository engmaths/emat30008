* NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib ([Jupyter Notebook](/assets/basics/Week13-Packages.ipynb))
* Version control with git and GitHub ([Jupyter Notebook](/assets/basics/Week13-Git.ipynb))

(or equivalent).

In addition, we will discuss coding workflows:
* Spyder
* Visual Studio Code and the terminal
* Jupyter Notebooks ([Notes](jupyter-notes/))


# Week 13: Exercises

* [Core Python exercises](/assets/basics/Week13-Python.pdf)
* [Using Jupyter notebooks](jupyter-exercise/)

Work on these exercises during the lab session, drop-in session,
and at home.  If you can complete all of these exercises without
major issues, then you should have a good foundation for the unit.
If you are struggling, then please seek help at the drop-in sessions
on Fridays.
