Rather than being a discrete piece of work, the coursework will be the <em>cumulation of material covered each week of the course</em>. Each week will build on the previous and form part of the assessment.</p> <p>The University&#39;s <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/assessment/regulations-and-code-of-practice-for-taught-programmes/marking-criteria/">generic marking criteria</a> will be used in the assessment of the coursework.</p> <p>The final submission of the coursework should consist of</p> <ol> <li><p>a clean Git repository, i.e., <code>git status</code> gives no warnings of uncommitted files or changes, containing the software developed and the development history, and</p> <li><p>a short report &#40;maximum 15 pages, aim for 8&ndash;10 pages&#41; describing the software produced and the thought processes that you went through to create it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fndef:1" class=fnref >[1]</a></sup>.</p> </ol> <p>The two parts of the coursework, code and report, will be weighted equally &#40;i.e., 50:50&#41;. Details about each component are below.</p> <p>There is no need to try hide mistakes you made in the software development process &mdash; this is a learning process. If you haven&#39;t made any mistakes, you probably haven&#39;t learnt anything.</p> <p>The <em>deadline for coursework submission can be found on Blackboard</em>. Submit your report via Blackboard and ensure that we have read access to your Git repository<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fndef:2" class=fnref >[2]</a></sup>.</p> <p><table class=fndef  id="fndef:1"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:1">[1]</a> <td class=fndef-content >Concise is good; 8&ndash;10 pages of good content is far better than 15 pages of waffle. </table> <table class=fndef  id="fndef:2"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:2">[2]</a> <td class=fndef-content >David Barton &#40;<code>@dawbarton</code> on GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket&#41;; Oscar Benjamin &#40;<code>@oscarbenjamin</code> on GitHub&#41;; and Martin Homer &#40;???&#41; </table> </p> <h2 id=git_repository_mdash_version_control ><a href="#git_repository_mdash_version_control">Git repository &mdash; version control</a></h2> <p>Everyone should create a new Git repository for this part of the unit. We expect you to commit <em>all your code</em> to this repository on a regular basis. As a general rule, if you&#39;ve been working on your uncommitted code for an hour &#40;or more&#41; then you should make another commit.</p> <p><strong>Remember to push your changes to the Git server periodically&#33;</strong> If you leave any files on the lab machines from session to session, they may not be there when you return.</p> <p>While it is possible to commit only the final version of your code &#40;i.e., with no history&#41; into the Git repository, you will not be attaining intended learning outcome 5. &#40;the use of sound software engineering principles&#41; and <strong>your work will be marked down accordingly</strong>.</p> <p>Version control is for code &#40;and other text&#41; but <em>not for data files</em>. If you generate any data or figures, it&#39;s good to put the scripts that generated them into Git but don&#39;t include the data or figures themselves<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fndef:3" class=fnref >[3]</a></sup>.</p> <p>By design, this part of the course builds up week-by-week and so it is natural to put the code in the same repository. Even if you end up creating a set of independent scripts to achieve the end goal &#40;which is far from the best way of doing it&#41;, these should all be committed to the same repository.</p> <p>Read <a href="https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/">Git Best Practices</a>.</p> <p>You will need to set yourself up with a new user account &#40;free&#33;&#41; on a public Git server; many providers provide enhanced functionality if you sign up with your university email address. Suggested providers are</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> &#40;recommended&#41;,</p> <li><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, and</p> <li><p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>.</p> </ul> <table class=fndef  id="fndef:3"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:3">[3]</a> <td class=fndef-content >Git has limited support for large data files &mdash; Git LFS &mdash; but it isn&#39;t that widespread yet. </table> <h2 id=report ><a href="#report">Report</a></h2> <p>The report should comprise</p> <ul> <li><p>a <em>brief</em> summary of your software &#40;30&#37; of the marks&#41;,</p> <li><p>a description of the key software design decisions made &#40;40&#37; of the marks&#41;, and</p> <li><p>a <em>reflective learning log</em> &#40;30&#37; of the marks&#41;.</p> </ul> <p>Penalties may be incurred if the page limit &#40;see the <a href="#overview">Overview</a>&#41; is exceeded.</p> <p>The reflective learning log is a key part of the report. The course is focusing on the development of software engineering skills rather than knowledge. Reviewing your learning in this way is a key part of developing your skills.</p> <p>From the <a href="https://help.open.ac.uk/be-aware-of-your-habits">Open University</a> reflective thinking can be described as</p> <ul> <li><p>thinking with a purpose</p> <li><p>being critical, but not negative</p> <li><p>analysing how effective your learning is</p> <li><p>questioning and probing</p> <li><p>making judgements and drawing conclusions.</p> </ul> <p>Key questions you should try to answer in your learning log are as follows.</p> <ul> <li><p>What did I learn about the mathematical algorithms? I.e., solving boundary value problems, numerical ill-conditioning, etc.</p> <li><p>What did I learn about software engineering? How have I progressed in my abilities?</p> <li><p>What are the short-term implications of what I&#39;ve learnt? &#40;When will it be useful?&#41;</p> <li><p>What are the long-term implications of what I&#39;ve learnt? &#40;When will it be useful?&#41;</p> <li><p>What would I have done differently if I started the unit over again?</p> <li><p>What will I do differently in the future?</p> </ul> <p>You will probably find it helpful to make notes on the answers to these questions each week.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Oscar Benjamin, David A.W.
