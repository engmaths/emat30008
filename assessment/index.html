Rather than being a discrete piece of work, the coursework will be the <em>cumulation of material covered each week of the course</em>. Each week will build on the previous and form part of the assessment.</p> <p>The University&#39;s <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/assessment/regulations-and-code-of-practice-for-taught-programmes/marking-criteria/">generic marking criteria</a> will be used in the assessment of the coursework.</p> <p>The final submission of the coursework should consist of</p> <ol> <li><p>a clean Git repository, i.e., <code>git status</code> gives no warnings of uncommitted files or changes, containing the software developed and the development history, and</p> <li><p>a short report written as a Jupyter notebook &#40;maximum 15 pages, aim for 8&ndash;10 pages&#41; describing the software produced and the thought processes that you went through to create it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fndef:1" class=fnref >[1]</a></sup>.</p> </ol> <p>The two parts of the coursework, code and report, will be weighted equally &#40;i.e., 50:50&#41;. Details about each component are below.</p> <p>There is no need to try hide mistakes you made in the software development process &mdash; this is a learning process. If you haven&#39;t made any mistakes, you probably haven&#39;t learnt anything.</p> <p>Ensure that we have read access to your Git repository<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fndef:2" class=fnref >[2]</a></sup>.</p> <p><table class=fndef  id="fndef:1"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:1">[1]</a> <td class=fndef-content >Concise is good; 8&ndash;10 pages of good content is far better than 15 pages of waffle. </table> <table class=fndef  id="fndef:2"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:2">[2]</a> <td class=fndef-content >David Barton &#40;<code>@dawbarton</code> on GitHub&#41;; Matthew Hennessy &#40;<code>@hennessymatt</code> on GitHub&#41; </table> </p> <h2 id=software ><a href="#software" class=header-anchor >Software</a></h2> <p>The aim of the coursework is to integrate the work you do from each week into a single piece of software. The software should be a general numerical continuation code that can track, under variations of a parameter in the system, </p> <ul> <li><p>limit cycle oscillations of arbitrary ordinary differential equations &#40;of any number of dimensions&#41;, and</p> <li><p>steady-states of second-order diffusive PDEs.</p> </ul> <p>You should take care to define appropriate interfaces between each of the components so that the resulting code is modular and follows the DRY &#40;Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself&#41; principle.</p> <p>The code should take the form of a library &#40;like, for example, the <code>solve_ivp</code> function in SciPy&#41; and provide one or more functions that take as input</p> <ul> <li><p>the differential equation &#40;either an ODE or PDE&#41; in a suitable form,</p> <li><p>the parameter values, and</p> <li><p>a starting guess for the initial variable values &#40;and period of oscillation if appropriate&#41;.</p> </ul> <p>The function should return the branch of solutions calculated for a range of parameter values.</p> <p>Moreover, you should provide time simulation codes for both ODEs and PDEs to enable the &#40;stable&#41; solutions to be verified.</p> <p>Your code should be fully tested against a range of inputs and &#40;known&#41; outputs. Inputs that do not have a solution should be handled gracefully.</p> <p>Your code should be documented appropriately.</p> <p>Examples of running your code should be provided for both ODEs and PDEs. There should be no user input &#40;i.e., typing into the terminal&#41; required when running the examples.</p> <p>Even if you are not able to complete the entire coursework, you should aim, insofar as possible, to demonstrate an understanding of the software engineering principles and mathematical concepts taught in the course.</p> <div class="admonition note"><p class=admonition-title >Note</p><p>The final code should be in the form of one or more <code>.py</code> files &#40;<em>not</em> a Jupyter notebook&#41; so they can be used as a library.</p> </div> <h2 id=git_repository ><a href="#git_repository" class=header-anchor >Git repository</a></h2> <p>Everyone should create a new Git repository, hosted on GitHub, for this unit. We expect you to commit <em>all your code</em> to this repository on a regular basis. As a general rule, if you&#39;ve been working on your uncommitted code for an hour &#40;or more&#41; then you should make another commit.</p> <p><strong>Remember to push your changes to GitHub periodically&#33;</strong> If you leave any files on the lab machines from session to session, they may not be there when you return.</p> <p>While it is possible to commit only the final version of your code &#40;i.e., with no history&#41; into the Git repository, you will not be attaining intended learning outcome 5. &#40;the use of sound software engineering principles&#41; and <strong>your work will be marked down accordingly</strong>.</p> <p>Version control is for code &#40;and other text&#41; but <em>not for data files</em>. If you generate any data or figures, it&#39;s good to put the scripts that generated them into Git but don&#39;t include the data or figures themselves<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fndef:3" class=fnref >[3]</a></sup>.</p> <p>By design, this part of the course builds up week-by-week and so it is natural to put the code in the same repository. Even if you end up creating a set of independent scripts to achieve the end goal &#40;which is far from the best way of doing it&#41;, these should all be committed to the same repository.</p> <p>Read <a href="https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/">Git Best Practices</a>.</p> <table class=fndef  id="fndef:3"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:3">[3]</a> <td class=fndef-content >Git has limited support for large data files &mdash; Git LFS &mdash; but it isn&#39;t that widespread yet. </table> <h2 id=report ><a href="#report" class=header-anchor >Report</a></h2> <p>The report should comprise</p> <ul> <li><p>a <em>brief</em> summary of your software &#40;30&#37; of the marks&#41;,</p> <li><p>a description of the key software design decisions made &#40;40&#37; of the marks&#41;, and</p> <li><p>a <em>reflective learning log</em> &#40;30&#37; of the marks&#41;.</p> </ul> <p>Penalties may be incurred if the page limit &#40;see the <a href="#overview">Overview</a>&#41; is exceeded.</p> <p>The reflective learning log is a key part of the report. The course is focusing on the development of software engineering skills rather than knowledge.

For example, explain what methods are implemented &#40;<strong>do not</strong> explain how the methods work&#41; and provide some examples, with results, of it in use. Code samples may be appropriate but they should be short and for the purpose of demonstration only.</p> <h3 id=description_of_the_key_software_design_decisions ><a href="#description_of_the_key_software_design_decisions" class=header-anchor >Description of the key software design decisions</a></h3> <p>The key design decisions should be described; explain your thinking behind the overall structure and interfaces of your code. If your code structure is intricate, a block diagram might be appropriate. Why were the solvers implemented as they are? What alternative designs might have been appropriate and why were they not pursued?</p> <h3 id=reflective_learning_log ><a href="#reflective_learning_log" class=header-anchor >Reflective learning log</a></h3> <p>From the <a href="https://help.open.ac.uk/be-aware-of-your-habits">Open University</a> reflective thinking can be described as</p> <ul> <li><p>thinking with a purpose</p> <li><p>being critical, but not negative</p> <li><p>analysing how effective your learning is</p> <li><p>questioning and probing</p> <li><p>making judgements and drawing conclusions.</p> </ul> <p>Key questions you should try to answer in your learning log are as follows.</p> <ul> <li><p>What did I learn about the mathematical algorithms?
