# Software installation

## Required software

This unit will require the following software:

1. Python
2. NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
3. Jupyter Notebooks
4. Git
5. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## Installing Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter
Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter can be installed in one go by downloading and installing
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), which is recommended.

**Important**: When installing Anaconda, pay careful attention to any
options in the installer that refer to "adding Python to the PATH environment
variable" (see image below).  Make sure this option is **checked**.  Otherwise, it will not
be possible to run Python from a terminal.

## Installing git

If you are using Windows, then git can be downloaded from
the [git website](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  
Be sure the select the 64-bit standalone installer.
There are a lot of options to choose from when running the installer but it is
okay to use the options that are selected by default.  Again, it is important to
ensure that git is added to the PATH environment so make sure the appropriate
option is selected (see below).

If you use OSX, then to install git, just open a terminal type git and you should be offered to
"install the OSX command line tools". Follow the instructions and you should have git
installed.

## Install VS Code

Simply [download from the website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install.

## Post-installation steps

Once you have everything installed, [please check that it works correctly](/software/check).
